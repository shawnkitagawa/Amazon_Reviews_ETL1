Summary: I think the Vine program is postively biased but accurate than the non_vine review. It is hard to believe that over half of the reviewer didn't have no complain at all and gave a full star. Even though the product was good, people still have some complain and things that they wish in the product they bought. Overall because the non_vine review 5 star percentage rate is over 60 percent, the market in general have good products that satifies consumers need and that is probably the reason why the vine review 5 star percentage rate is over 50 percent but if you would ask me if its accurate, I would say it is accurate than the non_vine review but not perfect. When people usually write a review especially if we need to rate 1 to 5, to make it simple, people like to give either a lowest or highest so that they don't need to think deeply and explain why didn't they gave a full score or the lowest score.
